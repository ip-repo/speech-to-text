This webpage allows to convert speech to text and download it as text file.


You should use `chrome` for this page to work the right way.<br>
Allow microphone access and you may choose the language to speak.<br>

The speech recognition api work isn't supported on every browser and its behavior might change in from browser to broswer as well its accuracy and speed.<Br>
If you want to add a `.`, `?`,`,` or `new line` wait for the last words you speaked appear on the screen and say the sign you want.<br>
For exmaple in english for a comma say `comma`.

You can also use it on local `http` server but bare in mind that the speech is proccessed by the browser `speech recogintion service` that needs internet connection.
